## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your computer. Don't worry — we'll guide you through each one!

### 1. Python 3.11 or higher

> **What is Python?** Python is the programming language this project is built with.

1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Click **"Download Python 3.11.x"** (or newer)
3. Run the installer
4. ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** On the first screen of the installer, check **"Add Python to PATH"** before clicking Install!
5. Verify it worked — open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows) and type:
   ```
   python --version
   ```
   You should see something like `Python 3.11.9`

### 2. Git

> **What is Git?** Git is a tool that lets you download code from the internet.

1. Go to [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Download and install for your operating system (use all default settings)
3. Verify it worked:
   ```
   git --version
   ```

### 3. A Google Chrome or Chromium browser

The test recorder uses a special version of Chromium (it gets installed automatically in the setup steps below).

## 🚀 Setup Instructions (Step by Step)

Follow these steps carefully. Each command should be typed into your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux).

### Step 1: Download the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pvsairam/testcase.git
cd testcase
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

> **What is this?** A virtual environment is like a clean, isolated room for Python. It keeps this project's dependencies separate from everything else on your computer.

**On Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

✅ When it's active, you'll see `(.venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> This will download all the required libraries. It may take 2-5 minutes on first run.

### Step 4: Install Playwright Browsers

```bash
playwright install chromium
```

> This downloads a special version of Chromium (Chrome) that Playwright uses for automation. ~150 MB download.

### Step 5: Configure Your Environment

Copy the example configuration file:

**On Windows:**
```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now open the `.env` file in any text editor (Notepad works fine) and fill in your details:

```ini
# The full URL of your Oracle Fusion instance
FUSION_URL=https://your-instance.fa.ap1.oraclecloud.com

# Your Oracle Fusion login username
FUSION_USER=your.username@company.com

# A short name for your pod/instance (used in reports)
FUSION_POD=MY-POD

# Your initials (used to organise output folders)
CONSULTANT=ABC

# Server settings — leave these as-is unless you have a conflict
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=8001

# Where to store the database and test output
DB_PATH=data/qap.db
OUTPUT_ROOT=output
```

### Step 6: Store Your Password Securely

Instead of putting your password in a plain text file, this project uses your operating system's secure keyring (like Windows Credential Manager). Run:

```bash
python scripts/setup_keyring.py
```

You will be prompted to type your Oracle Fusion password. It will be stored securely — never in a text file.

### Step 7: Initialize the Database

```bash
python scripts/init_db.py
```

This creates the local database file that stores your tests and run history.

### Step 8: Start the Application!

```bash
python main.py serve
```

You will see:
```
QA Platform started on http://127.0.0.1:8001
```

Open your browser and go to **[http://127.0.0.1:8001](http://127.0.0.1:8001)** 🎉

## 📖 How to Use

### 🎥 Recording a Test

1. Click **"Quick Record"** in the top navigation bar
2. Enter the URL you want to test and click **"Start Recording"**
3. A browser window will open — perform your test steps manually (clicking, typing, etc.)
4. When done, click **"Stop Recording"** in the dashboard
5. Your steps are saved and ready to replay!

### ▶️ Replaying a Test

1. Go to the **Tests** page
2. Find your test and click **"Run"**
3. The system will automatically log in to Oracle Fusion and replay every step
4. Watch the progress in the **Runs** page
5. Download the **Excel Report** when complete — it includes screenshots of every step!

### 🤖 AI Studio (AI-Powered Test Generation)

> Requires an OpenAI API Key. Get one at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com).

1. Click **"AI Studio"** in the navigation
2. Select your LLM Provider (OpenAI recommended)
3. Enter your API Key
4. Upload your test case file (Excel `.xlsx`, CSV, or plain text `.txt`)
5. Enter a Test Name and the Target URL
6. Click **"Translate to NLP"** for a fast conversion of your steps into structured JSON
7. Or click **"Generate & Record (Agent)"** to have the AI autonomously perform the steps in a real browser and record them!

---

## 🐳 Docker (Optional)

If you prefer to use Docker instead of installing Python locally:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Then open **[http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001)**

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "python is not recognized as an internal or external command"
→ Python was not added to your PATH. Uninstall Python and re-install it, making sure to check **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation.

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '...'"
→ Your virtual environment might not be active. Run `.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows) or `source .venv/bin/activate` (Mac/Linux) and try again.

### "playwright: command not found"
→ Make sure your virtual environment is active, then run `pip install playwright` followed by `playwright install chromium`.

### The browser opens but the test fails immediately
→ Check that your `.env` file has the correct `FUSION_URL` and `FUSION_USER`. Also make sure you have run `python scripts/setup_keyring.py` to save your password.

### "Address already in use" when starting the server
→ Another app is using port 8001. Change `PORT=8002` in your `.env` file.

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- **Your password is NEVER stored in a file.** It uses the operating system's secure credential store (Windows Credential Manager / macOS Keychain / Linux Secret Service).
- **Your `.env` file is in `.gitignore`** — it will never be accidentally uploaded to GitHub.
- **API keys** (OpenAI, etc.) are entered in the UI at runtime and are not stored in the database.
